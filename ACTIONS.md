# Actions for Citizens

## Identify Your State

Different states have different political processes, so it's important to identify which state you live in. If you own or rent property, this will be the two-letter state abbreviation on your address. If you don't have property, it's probably easiest to find someone near you who does, and ask them what state you're in.

## Identify Your Current National Legislators

### Identify Your House Represenative

See http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/

Each district has one Representative in the US House, who represents everyone in the district. This is your most local representative in national government.

### Identify Your Senators

See: http://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/

Each state has two Senators, who both represent your whole state.

## Register to Vote

See https://www.usa.gov/register-to-vote

Government representatives get their jobs via elections, so tend to be more responsive to registered voters.
